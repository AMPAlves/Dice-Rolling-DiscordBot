### Discord Bot - Dice Rolling Bets :

Heavily inspired by the World of Warcraft community created casino-esque type games. The dice rolling bets were pretty common among player who wanted to bet with their in-game gold , the demand was out there and so were the dealers/bookmakers.
My objective was to recreate this small little game in the discord enviourment , making it possible to play it among friends and fellow strangers.

### How to Play - (Pretty Straight Forward) :
  - In order to bet you need to create your account using '/login'.
  - Right after that you should have , expectedly , 500g. ('g' is our currency)
  - To make any sort of bet you need to type the following : '/roll *amount* *@Opponent*'.
  - Waiting for your opponent is , also , part of the game.
  - Now you just need some help from Lady Luck itself. (Yes , it's that simple!)

### Features Implemented :
  - Checking your balance.
  - Refilling your account gold (Works once every 24h).
  - Checking your luck/winrate.
  - Cross-Server Ladder Rankings
  
### Features which MIGHT get implemented :
  - Race & Class choice (Respecting the Classic WoW Race/Class options).
  - Embebded message system
  - Ranks
  - Random events command
  - Singleplayer gold gathering
  - Inventory / Item system
